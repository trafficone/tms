* Create(or find) a solid text/images-based Captcha engine
  - build it into a controller
  - create an auth pairing system ie captcha_resp='ball'&captcha_auth=h823h8va89, so auth can happen
     without the need for storing captcha messages
* Build out user registration functionality
  - finish out the controller portion
  - write in the verification email to send
  - the verification should be easy, and the email bit should come from the contact page logic
* Constriuct the profile editing page
  - build the controller portion
  - make the forms, and submission ui
* Build an article cration page
  - maybe use one of those fancy Javascript WYSIWYG editors 
  - The controller shouldn't be too complex
